# Website Project Instructions

## Skills to Use

Always use the **website** skill (`/website`) when working in this directory for managing the site.

## Skill Maintenance

**IMPORTANT**: Proactively update `.claude/commands/website.md` whenever:
- New pages are added to the site
- Site structure changes
- New common tasks or patterns emerge
- Better workflows are discovered

Keep the skill up-to-date without being asked. The skill should always reflect the current state of the site.

## Site Structure

- `index.html` - Homepage
- `reading-list.html` - Reading list page
- `style.css` - Shared styles

## Quick Reference

### Adding to Reading List
Add entries to `reading-list.html` in the `<ul class="links">` section.
