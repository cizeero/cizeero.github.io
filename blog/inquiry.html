            <p>Inquiry is the process by which we engage with what we do not know. Discovery is not a process but a result, the moment when inquiry yields an answer. You cannot schedule discovery or manage it into existence. You can only inquire, and sometimes, and if the inquiry is deep enough, discovery arrives. What makes inquiry deep? Intervention. The world moves too fast and holds too much complexity to be understood through observation alone. To truly learn, you must act. You must push against reality and let reality push back. In that friction, in the resistance between your assumptions and the way things behave, discovery emerges.</p>

            <p>This is why experimentation sits at the heart of inquiry. To experiment is to inquire through intervention, to change something and watch what happens. But experimentation is not limited to laboratories. Engineering is experimentation. When you build something, you let the world intervene in your theory. You discover what holds and what breaks. Implementation is not separate from the research, it is also research. Each stage is an opportunity for the world to answer back, to reveal what you misunderstood, to show you something you could not have seen from the safety of abstraction and observation.</p>

            <p>Self-inquiry follows this pattern, reflection alone is incomplete. Examining your own thoughts can only go so far. The deeper inquiry of the self happens through action, through letting the world intervene. The hero in a story does not discover who they are by thinking but by being tested. Either you intervene in yourself through effort, or you let the world intervene in you through experience and consequence. There is no discovery without friction. To learn anything true, you must be willing to be changed by the encounter. Production, Implementation and other such words fit in here somewhere, but to find that out, you have to inquire.</p>
